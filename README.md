# gt

g(it)t(ools) is a bash based script which pulls a file or a directory stored in a git repository.
It includes automatic verification via GPG.  
It enables that files can be maintained at a single place and pulled into multiple projects (e.g. scripts, config files
etc.)
In this sense, gt is a bit like a package manager which is based on git repositories but without dependency resolution
and such.

<details>
<summary>The initial idea behind this project:</summary>

You have scripts you use in multiple projects and would like to have a single place where you maintain them.
Maybe you even made them public so that others can use them as well
(as we have done with [Tegonal scripts](https://github.com/tegonal/scripts)).
This tool provides an easy way to pull them into your project.

Likewise, you can use gt to pull other kind of scripts (not only bash scripts, e.g. gradle scripts), config files, 
templates etc. which you use in multiple projects but want to maintain at a single place.

# Installation

## using install.sh

`intall.sh` downloads the latest or a specific tag of gt and verifies gt's files against
the current GPG key (the one in the main branch).

We suggest you verify install.sh against the public key of this repository and
the public key of this repository against
[Tegonal's public key for github](https://tegonal.com/gpg/github.asc).

The following commands will do this but require you to first import our gpg key.
If you haven't done this already, then execute:

```
wget -O- https://www.tegonal.com/gpg/github.asc | gpg --import -
```

Now you are ready to execute the following commands which download and verify the public key as well as the install.sh
and of course execute the install.sh as such.


<install>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in install.sh.doc -->
```bash
currentDir=$(pwd) && \
tmpDir=$(mktemp -d -t gt-download-install-XXXXXXXXXX) && cd "$tmpDir" && \
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tegonal/gt/main/.gt/signing-key.public.asc" && \
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tegonal/gt/main/.gt/signing-key.public.asc.sig" && \
gpg --verify ./signing-key.public.asc.sig ./signing-key.public.asc && \
echo "public key trusted" && \
mkdir ./gpg && \
gpg --homedir ./gpg --import ./signing-key.public.asc && \
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tegonal/gt/v0.19.0/install.sh" && \
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tegonal/gt/v0.19.0/install.sh.sig" && \
gpg --homedir ./gpg --verify ./install.sh.sig ./install.sh && \
chmod +x ./install.sh && \
echo "verification successful" || (printf >&2 "\033[0;31mERROR\033[0m: verification failed, don't continue !!"; exit 1) && \
./install.sh && result=true || (echo >&2 "installation failed"; exit 1) && \
false || cd "$currentDir" && rm -r "$tmpDir" && "${result:-false}"
```

</install>

<details>
<summary>click here for an explanation of the commands</summary>

1. `mktemp ...`  
   create a temp directory so that we don't run into troubles overwriting files in your current dir
2. `wget .../signing-key.public.asc`  
   download the public key of this repo, which can be used to verify the integrity of released files.
3. `wget .../signing-key.public.asc.sig`    
   download the signature file of signing-key.public.asc
4. `gpg --verify ...`  
   verify the public key against your gpg store
5. `gpg --homedir ./gpg --import`  
   create a local gpg store and import the public key of this repository
6. `wget .../install.sh`  
   download the install.sh
7. `wget .../install.sh.sig`  
   download the signature file of install.sh
8. `gpg --homedir ./gpg --verify...`  
   verify the install.sh you downloaded is (still) valid against the public key of this repo
9. `chmod +x ./install.sh`  
   make install.sh executable
10. `echo "..."`  
	output the result of the verification
11. `./install.sh`
	execute the installation as such
12. `false || cd "$currentDir" && rm -r "$tmpDir ...`
	cleanup step: go back to where you have been before and delete the tmpDir

</details>

Per default, it downloads the latest tag and installs it into `$HOME/.local/lib/gt`
and sets up a symbolic link at `$HOME/.local/bin/gt`.

You can tweak this behaviour as shown as follows (replace the `./install.sh ...` command above):

```bash
# Download the latest tag, configure default installation directory and symbolic link
install.sh

# Download a specific tag, default installation directory and symbolic link
install.sh -t v0.3.0

# Download latest tag but custom installation directory, without the creation of a symbolic link
install.sh -d /opt/gt

# Download latest tag but custom installation directory and symlink
install.sh -d /opt/gt -ln /usr/local/bin
```

Last but not least, see [additional installation steps](#additional-installation-steps)

## manually

1. [![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-v0.19.0-%23007ec6)](https://github.com/tegonal/gt/releases/tag/v0.19.0)
2. extract the zip/tar.gz
3. open a terminal at the corresponding folder and verify the public key of this repo
   against [our public key](https://tegonal.com/gpg/github.asc):
   ```bash
   wget -O- https://tegonal.com/gpg/github.asc | gpg --import -
   gpg --verify ./signing-key.public.asc.sig ./signing-key.public.asc
   ```
4. then verify the files in ./src against the public key of this repository
   ```bash
   mkdir ./gpg
   gpg --homedir ./gpg --import ./signing-key.public.asc 
   find ./src -name "*.sig" -print0 | while read -r -d $'\0' sig; do gpg --homedir ./gpg --verify "$sig"; done && \
     echo "verification successful" || echo "verification failed, don't continue"
   rm -r ./gpg
   ```
5. copy the src directory to a place where you want to store gt:
	1. For instance, if you only want it for the current user, then place it into $HOME/.local/lib/gt
	2. if it shall be available for all users, then place it e.g. in /opt/gt or
	3. into your project directory in case you want that other contributors can use it as well without an own
	   installation
6. optional: create a symlink:
	1. only for the current user `ln -s "$HOME/.local/lib/gt/src/gt.sh" "$HOME/.local/bin/gt"`
	2. globally `ln -s "$HOME/.local/lib/gt/src/gt.sh" "/usr/local/bin/gt"`
	3. in project: `ln -s ./lib/gt/src/get.sh ./gt`
7. See [additional installation steps](#additional-installation-steps)

## additional installation steps

### .gitignore

Once you add your first remote via `gt remote add -r <remote_name> -u <url>` gt will ask you if it shall add the 
following to your `.gitignore` file (if there is one in the directory where you executed `gt`). 
Depending on your setup `gt` might not find it or you maybe want to add it in a different place:

```gitignore
.gt/**/repo
.gt/**/gpg
```

Whether you commit the fetched files or not (i.e. put them on the ignore list as well) is up to you.
For instance, if you don't want to commit them and you put everything into `lib/...` (default location) then you
would add the following to your `.gitignore` in addition

```gitignore
lib/**
```

Users cloning your project or pulling the latest changes would then execute:

```bash
gt re-pull
```

to fetch all ignored files.

### completions for zsh

if gt detects zsh during the installation and is able to find the vendor-completions directory, then it tries to add
the completion file into this directory (you need to enter the sudo password, so you should notice it). If for whatever
reason gt was not able to detect zsh or copy it you can of course copy it manually. Head over to the installation 
directory of gt (default `$HOME/.local/lib/gt`) and copy the file `src/install/zsh/_gt` into a directory which is your
`$fpath`.

gt pull -r tegonal-scripts -p src/utility/ask.sh -d ./scripts/ --chop-path true

# pull the file src/utility/checks.sh from remote tegonal-scripts
# from the latest version matching the specified tag-filter (i.e. one starting with v3)
gt pull -r tegonal-scripts -t v0.1.0 -p src/utility/ --tag-filter "^v3.*"
```

</gt-pull>

### pull hook

gt allows to hook into the pull process at two stages:

- before the file is moved from the downloaded path to the desired location
- after the file was moved to the desired location

If you want to use those hook, then you need create a `pull-hook.sh` in `<WORKGIN_DIR>/remotes/<REMOTE>/pull-hook.sh`
(for instance in `.gt/remotes/tegonal-scripts/pull-hook.sh`).

This file should contain two functions named `gt_pullHook_<REMOTE>_before` and `gt_pullHook_<REMOTE>_after`.
<REMOTE> is the name of the remote where all `-` are replaced by `_`.
So for the remote tegonal-scripts you should name the functions `gt_pullHook_tegonal_scripts_before`
and `gt_pullHook_tegonal_scripts_after`

These two functions will be called for each file which is pulled where the following arguments are passed.

1. tag specified via `-t|--target`
2. path of the file before the move to its target destination
3. target destination

For instance, a pull-hook.sh could look as follows:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -eu -o pipefail

function gt_pullHook_tegonal_scripts_before(){
  # no op, nothing to do
  true
}

function gt_pullHook_tegonal_scripts_after(){
  local -r tag=$1 source=$2 target=$3
  
  if [[ $source =~ .*.txt ]]; then
    # rename all *.txt to *.msg
    mv "$target" "${target%????}.msg"
  fi  
}
```

For a real world example, take a look at the
[pull-hook.sh](https://github.com/tegonal/gt/blob/main/.gt/remotes/tegonal-gh-commons/pull-hook.sh)
used in this repo.

## re-pull

Use this command to pull missing files form all or a specific remote. You can also use it to re-pull files even if they
already exist locally.

Following the output of running `gt re-pull --help`:

<gt-re-pull-help>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/gt-re-pull.sh -->
```text

--auto-trust             (optional) if set to true and GPG is not set up yet, then all keys in .gt/remotes/<remote>/public-keys/*.asc are imported without manual consent -- default: false
--only-missing           (optional) if set, then only files which do not exist locally are pulled, otherwise all are re-pulled -- default: true

--help     prints this help
--version  prints the version of this script

Examples:
# re-pull all files of remote tegonal-scripts which are missing locally
gt re-pull -r tegonal-scripts

# re-pull all files of all remotes which are missing locally

INFO: Version of gt-re-pull.sh is:
v0.20.0-SNAPSHOT
```

</gt-re-pull-help>

Full usage example:

<gt-re-pull>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/gt-re-pull.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# for each remote in .gt
# - re-pull files defined in .gt/remotes/<remote>/pulled.tsv which are missing locally
gt re-pull

# re-pull files defined in .gt/remotes/tegonal-scripts/pulled.tsv which are missing locally
gt re-pull -r tegonal-scripts

# pull all files defined in .gt/remotes/tegonal-scripts/pulled.tsv regardless if they already exist locally or not
gt re-pull -r tegonal-scripts --only-missing false

# uses a custom working directory and re-pulls files of remote tegonal-scripts which are missing locally
gt re-pull -r tegonal-scripts -w .github/.gt
```

</gt-re-pull>

## reset

Use this command to reset one or all remotes. By resetting we mean, re-establish trust (check GPG key again) and
re-fetch all files.

# - re-initialise gpg trust based on public keys defined in .gt/remotes/<remote>/public-keys/*.asc
# - pull files defined in .gt/remotes/<remote>/pulled.tsv
gt reset

# resets the remote tegonal-scripts which means:
# - re-initialise gpg trust based on public keys defined in .gt/remotes/tegonal-scripts/public-keys/*.asc
# - pull files defined in .gt/remotes/tegonal-scripts/pulled.tsv
gt reset -r tegonal-scripts

# uses a custom working directory and resets the remote tegonal-scripts which means:
# - re-initialise gpg trust based on public keys defined in .github/.gt/remotes/tegonal-scripts/public-keys/*.asc

--auto-trust             (optional) if set to true and GPG is not set up yet, then all keys in .gt/remotes/<remote>/public-keys/*.asc are imported without manual consent -- default: false
-t|--tag                 (optional) define from which tag files shall be pulled, only valid if remote via -r|--remote is specified

--help     prints this help
--version  prints the version of this script

Examples:
# updates all pulled files of all remotes to latest tag
gt update

# updates all pulled files of remote tegonal-scripts to latest tag
gt update -r tegonal-scripts

# updates/downgrades all pulled files of remote tegonal-scripts to tag v1.0.0
gt update -r tegonal-scripts -t v1.0.0

INFO: Version of gt-update.sh is:
v0.20.0-SNAPSHOT
```

</gt-update-help>

Full usage example:

<gt-update>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/gt-update.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# updates all pulled files of all remotes to latest tag according to the tag-filter of the file
gt update

# updates all pulled files of remote tegonal-scripts to latest tag according to the tag-filter of the file
gt update -r tegonal-scripts

# updates/downgrades all pulled files of remote tegonal-scripts to tag v1.0.0 if the tag-filter of the file matches,
# (i.e. a file with tag-filter v2.* would not be downgraded to v1.0.0).
# Side note, if no filter was specified during `gt pull`, then .* is used per default which includes all tags -- see
# pulled.tsv to see the current tagFilter in use per file
gt update -r tegonal-scripts -t v1.0.0
```

</gt-update>

### GitHub Workflow

This repository contains a github workflow which runs every week to check if there are updates for:

- the files which have been pulled as well as
- the public keys of the remotes.

It requires you to define a variable named PUBLIC_GPG_KEYS_WE_TRUST which represents an armored export of all
gpg public keys you trust signing the public keys of remotes, 
i.e. those are used to verify the public keys of the remotes you added via `gt remote add`.

You can define two optional secrets in addition which steer the PR creation which is done via the github action
[peter-evans/create-pull-request](https://github.com/peter-evans/create-pull-request):
- `AUTO_PR_TOKEN` is used as `token`
- `AUTO_PR_FORK_NAME` is used as `push-to-fork` (we look first for a variable `AUTO_PR_FORK_NAME` and fallback to a secret afterwards)

You can re-use the workflow in your repository. We suggest you fetch it via gt üòâ

```bash
gt remote add -r gt -u https://github.com/tegonal/gt
gt pull -r gt -p .github/workflows/gt-update.yml -d ./ 
```

Accordingly, you would add [Tegonal's public key for github](https://tegonal.com/gpg/github.asc) to PUBLIC_GPG_KEYS_WE_TRUST in order
that this workflow can update the workflow itself.

#### Required modifications

You need to change one condition in the workflow which we added in order that this workflow does not run in forks:

```yml
if: github.repository_owner == 'tegonal'
```

Which means you should rewrite that part it in the [pull-hook.sh](#pull-hook) of the gt remote, i.e.
in `.gt/remotes/gt/pull-hook.sh`. It could look as follows:

```bash
set -eu -o pipefail

function gt_pullHook_gt_before(){
  local -r _tag=$1 source=$2 _target=$3
  
  if [[ $source =~ .*/.github/workflows/gt-update.yml ]]; then
    perl -0777 -i -pe "s/(if: github.repository_owner == )'tegonal'/\${1}'YOUR_SLUG'/" "$source"
  fi  
}

function gt_pullHook_gt_after(){
  # no op, nothing to do
  true
}
```

Just make sure you replace YOUR_SLUG with your actual slug.

### Gitlab Job

The setup requires three steps:
1. pull files and include in your .gitlab-ci.yml
2. configure Variables and Deploy Keys
3. Set up a Scheduled Pipeline

#### setup .gitlab-ci.yml

This repository contains a `.gitlab-ci.yml` which defines two job templates:
1. gt-update which checks if there are updates for:
   - the files which have been pulled
   - the public keys of the remotes

   and creates a Merge Request if there are some.

2. gt-update-stop-pipeline which cancels itself and thus stops the pipeline

You can re-use it in your repository. We suggest you fetch it via gt üòâ

```bash
gt remote add -r gt -u https://github.com/tegonal/gt
gt pull -r gt -p src/gitlab/
```

In your `.gitlab-ci.yml` you need to add `gt` to your stages and it should be the first stage:
```yml
stages:
- gt
...
```
At some point you add in addition
```yml
include: 'lib/gt/src/gitlab/.gitlab-ci.yml'
```

That's it, this defines the two jobs. Yet, you need some extra configuration to be ready to use it...

<details>
<summary>I need some modifications to the standard job</summary>

If you need to run additional before_script or the like, then you can re-define
the job e.g. as follows (after the `include` above):
```yaml
gt-update:
  extends: .gt-update
  # your modifications here, e.g. for an additional step in before_script
  before_script:
	- !reference [.gt-update, before_script]
    - cd subdirectory
```

</details>

#### Additional configuration

The `gt-update` job (the `install-gt.sh` to be precise) 
requires you to define a variable named PUBLIC_GPG_KEYS_WE_TRUST which represents an armored export of all
gpg public keys you trust signing the public keys of remotes, 
i.e. those are used to verify the public keys of the remotes you added via `gt remote add`.

For instance, if you fetched the gitlab job via gt as suggested, 
then you would add [Tegonal's public key for github](https://tegonal.com/gpg/github.asc) 
to PUBLIC_GPG_KEYS_WE_TRUST in order that this job can update itself.

Moreover, the `create-mr.sh` requires an access token which is stored in variable GT_UPDATE_API_TOKEN. 
It is used to create the merge request.

The gitlab job uses the image [gitlab-git](https://github.com/tegonal/gitlab-git) which requires you to define 
the variable GITBOT_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY and a deploy key for it. 
See [Basic Setup](https://github.com/tegonal/gitlab-git#basic-setup) for more information

#### Scheduled job

Now, all that is left is to create a scheduled pipeline (CI/CD -> Schedules) where you need to define Variable 
`DO_GT_UPDATE` with value `true`. Up to you how often you want to let it run (we run it weekly).

## self-update

You can update gt by using gt (which in turn uses its install.sh)
Following the output of running `gt self-update --help`:

<gt-self-update-help>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/gt-self-update.sh -->
```text
Parameters:
--force   if set to true, then install.sh will be called even if gt is already on latest tag -- default false

--help     prints this help
--version  prints the version of this script

Examples:
# updates gt to the latest tag
gt self-update

# updates gt to the latest tag and downloads the sources even if already on the latest
gt self-update --force

INFO: Version of gt-self-update.sh is:
v0.20.0-SNAPSHOT
```

</gt-self-update-help>

# FAQ

## 1. How is gt different from git submodules?

Short version:

- git (v2.73.3) submodules only support to checkout a certain branch but not a certain tag.
- gt only supports to pull files from a certain tag but not from a random branch or sha

Longer version:

- gt also integrates file integrity checks based on GPG
- allows to fetch only parts of a repository (maybe possible for submodules via sparse checkout)
- allows to place it at different places
- is not intended to push changes back

# Does gt run on all linux distros?

Most likely not, it was tested only on Ubuntu 22.04.  
For instance, on alpine you need to `apk add bash git gnupg perl coreutils` to make `gt update` work 
(could be that executing other gt commands require more dependencies).
