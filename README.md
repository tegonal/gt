# gget

g(it)get is a bash based script which pulls a file or a directory stored in a git repository.
It includes automatic verification via GPG.  
It enables that files can be maintained at a single place and pulled into multiple projects (e.g. scripts, config files
etc.)
In this sense, gget is a bit like a package manager which is based on git repositories but without dependency resolution
and such.

<details>
<summary>The initial idea behind this project:</summary>

You have scripts you use in multiple projects and would like to have a single place where you maintain them.
Maybe you even made them public so that others can use them as well
(as we have done with [Tegonal scripts](https://github.com/tegonal/scripts)).
This tool provides an easy way to pull them into your project.

Likewise, you can use gget to pull config files, templates etc. which you use in multiple projects but want to maintain
at a single place.

</details>

‚ùó You are taking a _sneak peek_ at the next version.
Please have a look at the README of the git tag in case you are looking for the documentation of the corresponding
version.

# Installation

## using install.sh

`intall.sh` downloads the latest or a specific tag of gget and verifies gget's files against
the current GPG key (the one in the main branch).

We suggest you verify install.sh against the public key of this repository and
the public key of this repository against
[Tegonal's public key for github](https://tegonal.com/gpg/github.asc).

The following commands will do this but require you to first import our gpg key.
If you haven't done this already, then execute:

```
wget -O- https://www.tegonal.com/assets/gpg/github.asc | gpg --import -
```

Now you are ready to execute the following commands which download and verify the public key as well as the install.sh
and of course execute the install.sh as such.


<install>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in install.sh -->
```bash
currentDir=$(pwd) && \
tmpDir=$(mktemp -d -t gget-download-install-XXXXXXXXXX) && cd "$tmpDir" && \
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tegonal/gget/main/.gget/signing-key.public.asc" && \
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tegonal/gget/main/.gget/signing-key.public.asc.sig" && \
gpg --verify ./signing-key.public.asc.sig ./signing-key.public.asc && \
echo "public key trusted" && \
mkdir ./gpg && \
gpg --homedir ./gpg --import ./signing-key.public.asc && \
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tegonal/gget/main/install.sh" && \
wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tegonal/gget/main/install.sh.sig" && \
gpg --homedir ./gpg --verify ./install.sh.sig ./install.sh && \
chmod +x ./install.sh && \
echo "verification successful" && verificationResult=true || (echo "verification failed, don't continue"; exit 1) && \
./install.sh && \
false || cd "$currentDir" && rm -r "$tmpDir" && "${verificationResult:-false}"
```

</install>

<details>
<summary>click here for an explanation of the commands</summary>

1. `mktemp ...`  
   create a temp directory so that we don't run into troubles overwriting files in your current dir
2. `wget .../signing-key.public.asc`  
   download the public key of this repo, which can be used to verify the integrity of released files.
3. `wget .../signing-key.public.asc.sig`    
   download the signature file of signing-key.public.asc
4. `gpg --verify ...`  
   verify the public key against your gpg store
5. `gpg --homedir ./gpg --import`  
   create a local gpg store and import the public key of this repository
6. `wget .../install.sh`  
   download the install.sh
7. `wget .../install.sh.sig`  
   download the signature file of install.sh
8. `gpg --homedir ./gpg --verify...`  
   verify the install.sh you downloaded is (still) valid against the public key of this repo
9. `chmod +x ./install.sh`  
   make install.sh executable
10. `echo "..."`  
	output the result of the verification
11. `./install.sh`
	execute the installation as such
12. `false || cd "$currentDir" && rm -r "$tmpDir ...`
	cleanup step: go back to where you have been before and delete the tmpDir

</details>

Per default, it downloads the latest tag and installs it into `$HOME/.local/lib/gget`
and sets up a symbolic link at `$HOME/.local/bin/gget`.

You can tweak this behaviour as shown as follows (replace the `./install.sh ...` command above):

```bash
# Download the latest tag, configure default installation directory and symbolic link
install.sh

# Download a specific tag, default installation directory and symbolic link
install.sh -t v0.3.0

# Download latest tag but custom installation directory, without the creation of a symbolic link
install.sh -d /opt/gget

# Download latest tag but custom installation directory and symlink
install.sh -d /opt/gget -ln /usr/local/bin
```

Last but not least, see [additional installation steps](#additional-installation-steps)

## manually

1. [![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-v0.6.1-%23007ec6)](https://github.com/tegonal/gget/releases/tag/v0.6.1)
2. extract the zip/tar.gz
3. open a terminal at the corresponding folder and verify the public key of this repo
   against [our public key](https://tegonal.com/gpg/github.asc):
   ```bash
   wget -O- https://tegonal.com/gpg/github.asc | gpg --import -
   gpg --verify ./signing-key.public.asc.sig ./signing-key.public.asc
   ```
4. then verify the files in ./src against the public key of this repository
   ```bash
   mkdir ./gpg
   gpg --homedir ./gpg --import ./signing-key.public.asc 
   find ./src -name "*.sig" -print0 | while read -r -d $'\0' sig; do gpg --homedir ./gpg --verify "$sig"; done && \
     echo "verification successful" || echo "verification failed, don't continue"
   rm -r ./gpg
   ```
5. copy the src directory to a place where you want to store gget:
	1. For instance, if you only want it for the current user, then place it into $HOME/.local/lib/gget
	2. if it shall be available for all users, then place it e.g. in /opt/gget or
	3. into your project directory in case you want that other contributors can use it as well without an own
	   installation
6. optional: create a symlink:
	1. only for the current user `ln -s "$HOME/.local/lib/gget/src/gget.sh" "$HOME/.local/bin/gget"`
	2. globally `ln -s "$HOME/.local/lib/gget/src/gget.sh" "/usr/local/bin/gget"`
	3. in project: `ln -s ./lib/gget/src/get.sh ./gget`
7. See [additional installation steps](#additional-installation-steps)

## additional installation steps

Typically, you add the following to your .gitignore file when fetching files via gget in your repository:

```gitignore
.gget/**/repo
.gget/**/gpg
```

Whether you commit the fetched files or not (i.e. put them on the ignore list as well) is up to you.
For instance, if you don't want to commit them and you put everything into `lib/...` (default location) then you
would add the following to your `.gitignore` in addition

```gitignore
lib/**
```

Users cloning your project or pulling the latest changes would then execute:

```bash
gget re-pull
```

to fetch all ignored files.

```

</gget-pull-help>

Full usage example:

<gget-pull>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/gget-pull.sh -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# pull the file src/utility/update-bash-docu.sh from remote tegonal-scripts

gget pull -r tegonal-scripts -t v0.1.0 -p src/utility/update-bash-docu.sh

# pull the directory src/utility/ from remote tegonal-scripts
# in version v0.1.0 (i.e. tag v0.1.0 is used)
gget pull -r tegonal-scripts -t v0.1.0 -p src/utility/
```

</gget-pull>

### pull hook

gget allows to hook into the pull process at two stages:

- before the file is moved from the downloaded path to the desired location
- after the file was moved to the desired location

If you want to use those hook, then you need create a `pull-hook.sh` in `<WORKGIN_DIR>/remotes/<REMOTE>/pull-hook.sh`
(for instance in `.gget/remotes/tegonal-scripts/pull-hook.sh`).

This file should contain two functions named `gget_pullHook_<REMOTE>_before` and `gget_pullHook_<REMOTE>_after`.
<REMOTE> is the name of the remote where all `-` are replaced by `_`.
So for the remote tegonal-scripts you should name the functions `gget_pullHook_tegonal_scripts_before`
and `gget_pullHook_tegonal_scripts_after`

These two functions will be called for each file which is pulled where the following arguments are passed.

1. tag specified via `-t|--target`
2. path of the file before the move to its target destination
3. target destination

For instance, a pull-hook.sh could look as follows:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -eu -o pipefail

function gget_pullHook_tegonal_scripts_before(){
  # no op, nothing to do
  true
}

function gget_pullHook_tegonal_scripts_after(){
  local -r tag=$1 source=$2 target=$3
  
  if [[ $source =~ .*.txt ]]; then
    # rename all *.txt to *.msg
    mv "$target" "${target%????}.msg"
  fi  
}
```

For a real world example, take a look at the
[pull-hook.sh](https://github.com/tegonal/gget/blob/main/.gget/remotes/tegonal-gh-commons/pull-hook.sh)
used in this repo.

## re-pull

Use this command to pull missing files form all or a specific remote. You can also use it to re-pull files even if they
already exist locally.

Following the output of running `gget re-pull --help`:

<gget-re-pull-help>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/gget-re-pull.sh -->
```text
Parameters:
-r|--remote              (optional) if set, only the remote with this name is reset, otherwise all are reset
-w|--working-directory   (optional) path which gget shall use as working directory -- default: .gget
--auto-trust             (optional) if set to true, all public-keys stored in .gget/remotes/<remote>/public-keys/*.asc are imported without manual consent -- default: false
--only-missing           (optional) if set, then only files which do not exist locally are pulled, otherwise all are re-pulled -- default: true

--help     prints this help
--version  prints the version of this script

Examples:
# re-pull all files of remote tegonal-scripts which are missing locally
gget re-pull -r tegonal-scripts

# re-pull all files of all remotes which are missing locally
gget re-pull

# re-pull all files (not only missing) of remote tegonal-scripts, imports gpg keys without manual consent if necessary
gget re-pull -r tegonal-scripts --only-missing false --auto-trust true

INFO: Version of gget-re-pull.sh is:
v0.7.0-SNAPSHOT
```

</gget-re-pull-help>

Full usage example:

<gget-re-pull>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/gget-re-pull.sh -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# for each remote in .gget
# - re-pull files defined in .gget/remotes/<remote>/pulled.tsv which are missing locally
gget re-pull

# re-pull files defined in .gget/remotes/tegonal-scripts/pulled.tsv which are missing locally
gget re-pull -r tegonal-scripts

# pull all files defined in .gget/remotes/tegonal-scripts/pulled.tsv regardless if they already exist locally or not
gget re-pull -r tegonal-scripts --only-missing false

# uses a custom working directory and re-pulls files of remote tegonal-scripts which are missing locally
gget re-pull -r tegonal-scripts -w .github/.gget
```

</gget-re-pull>

## reset

Use this command to reset one or all remotes. By resetting we mean, re-establish trust (check GPG key again) and
re-fetch all files.

Following the output of running `gget reset --help`:

<gget-reset-help>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/gget-reset.sh -->

--gpg-only               (optional) if set, then only the gpg keys are reset but the files are not re-pulled -- default: false

--help     prints this help
--version  prints the version of this script

Examples:
# reset the remote tegonal-scripts
gget reset -r tegonal-scripts

# resets all remotes
gget reset

# resets the gpg keys of all remotes without re-pulling the corresponding files
gget reset --gpg-only true

INFO: Version of gget-reset.sh is:

# - pull files defined in .gget/remotes/<remote>/pulled.tsv
gget reset

# resets the remote tegonal-scripts which means:
# - re-initialise gpg trust based on public keys defined in .gget/remotes/tegonal-scripts/public-keys/*.asc
# - pull files defined in .gget/remotes/tegonal-scripts/pulled.tsv
gget reset -r tegonal-scripts

# uses a custom working directory and resets the remote tegonal-scripts which means:
# - re-initialise gpg trust based on public keys defined in .github/.gget/remotes/tegonal-scripts/public-keys/*.asc
# - pull files defined in .github/.gget/remotes/tegonal-scripts/pulled.tsv

```

</gget-update>

### GitHub Workflow

This repository contains a github workflow which runs every week to check if there are updates for:
- the files which have been pulled as well as 
- the public keys of the remotes.

You can re-use it in your repository. We suggest you fetch it via gget üòâ

```bash
gget remote add -r gget -u https://github.com/tegonal/gget
gget pull -r gget -p .github/workflows/gget-update.yml -d ./ 
```

Note thought, that it contains the following condition (so that it does not run in forks):

```yml
if: github.repository_owner == 'tegonal'
```

Which means you should rewrite that part it in the [pull-hook.sh](#pull-hook) of the gget remote, i.e.
in `.gget/remotes/gget/pull-hook.sh`. It could look as follows:

```bash
set -eu -o pipefail

function gget_pullHook_gget_before(){
  local -r _tag=$1 source=$2 _target=$3
  
  if [[ $source =~ .*/.github/workflows/gget-update.yml ]]; then
    perl -0777 -i -pe "s/(if: github.repository_owner == )'tegonal'/\${1}'YOUR_SLUG'/" "$source"
  fi  
}

function gget_pullHook_gget_after(){
  # no op, nothing to do
  true
}
```
Just make sure you replace YOUR_SLUG with your actual slug. 

## self-update

You can update gget by using gget (which in turn uses its install.sh)
Following the output of running `gget self-update --help`:

<gget-self-update-help>

```text
Parameters:
--force   if set to true, then install.sh will be called even if gget is already on latest tag

--help     prints this help
--version  prints the version of this script

Examples:
# updates gget to the latest tag
gget self-update

# updates gget to the latest tag and downloads the sources even if already on the latest
gget self-update --force

# FAQ

## 1. How is gget different from git submodules?

Short version:

- git (v2.73.3) submodules only support to checkout a certain branch but not a certain tag.
- gget only supports to pull files from a certain tag but from a random branch

Longer version:

- gget also integrates file integrity checks based on GPG
- allows to fetch only parts of a repository (maybe possible for submodules via sparse checkout)
- allows to place it at different places
- is not intended to push changes back
