# SC2250 = Prefer putting braces around variable references even when not strictly required.
# disable because = IMO without braces reads nicer if not necessary

# SC2310 = warn if own function is called in a context which disables set -e
# disable because = we know that set -e is disabled in various scenarios (condition, left of ||, function which calls
# function was used in condition, left of || etc.). We use set -e as a maybe safety net in the sense of, if one
# forgets to handle the error case via `|| ...` (e.g. `|| return $?`) then set -e might do it.... maybe :)
