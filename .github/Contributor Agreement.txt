and interest worldwide in all Copyright covering the Contribution; provided that this transfer
is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3. In particular, You agree to transfer the
following rights:
1.	the right to use and to re-use in a whole or in part;
2.	the right to modify, including the right to translate and to re-write in a different
form;

publication, by press information services, by downloadable and non-
downloadable files, by communication with computer terminals; by sending of
telegrams, messages and wire service, by electronic and non-electronic
publications;

9.	the right to transfer to another environment (hardware, software, computer
electronic, Web, multimedia or other);
10.	the right to make improvements and derivative works;
11.	the right to store;
12.	the right to licence the above-mentioned rights.

(b) To the extent that any of the rights in Section 2.1(a) cannot be assigned by You to Us,
You grant to Us a perpetual, worldwide, exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable
licence under such non-assigned rights, with rights to sublicense through multiple tiers of
sub licensees, to practice such non-assigned rights, including, but not limited to, the right to
reproduce, modify, display, perform and distribute the Contribution; provided that this
licence is conditioned upon compliance with Section 2.3.

(c) To the extent that any of the rights in Section 2.1(a) can neither be assigned nor

grant to You a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, transferable, irrevocable
licence under such rights covering the Contribution, with rights to sublicense through
multiple tiers of sub licensees, to reproduce, modify, display, perform, and distribute the
Contribution. The intention of the parties is that this licence will be as broad as possible and
to provide You with rights as similar as possible to the owner of the rights that You
transferred. This licence back is limited to the Contribution and does not provide any rights
to the Work, which shall be subject to the outbound licence(s) as provided in Section 2.3.

irrevocable patent licence, with the right to sublicense these rights to multiple tiers of sub
licensees, to make, have made, use, sell, offer for sale, import and otherwise transfer the
Contribution and the Contribution in combination with the Work (and portions of such
combination). This licence is granted only to the extent that the exercise of the licensed
rights infringes such patent claims; and provided that this licence is conditioned upon
compliance with Section 2.3.

such licences are subsequently disapproved by relevant organisations (including any right to
adopt any future version of these licences).

permitted by law, You waive and agree not to assert such moral rights against Us or our
successors in interest, or any of our licensees, either direct or indirect.

this Agreement in one situation shall not affect the right of a party to require such

situation shall not be considered a waiver of the performance of the provision in the future
or a waiver of the provision in its entirety.
6.5 If any provision of this Agreement is found void and unenforceable, such provision will
be replaced to the extent possible with a provision that comes closest to the meaning of the
